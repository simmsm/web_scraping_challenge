# mars_scraping
Module 11 activity, using web scraping to find and extract data from a website.


This challenge scrapes titles and previews text from Mars News using
automated browsing (with Splinter) to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup).
The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted.
The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structureâ€”specifically, a list of dictionaries.

The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Either Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. 
The columns have the correct headings and data types.
